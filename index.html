                <h2 class="h-secondary center">113 vs KXIP IPL 2016 </h2>
                <p class="center">The 113-run knock played by Virat Kohli against Kings XI Punjab in 2016 was a crucial one as it helped his team, Royal Challengers Bangalore, win the match and keep their hopes alive in the Indian Premier League (IPL) that season.
                    At the time, Royal Challengers Bangalore had won only two out of their first six matches and were struggling in the tournament. Kohli, who was leading the team, had not yet found his form with the bat in the tournament and was under pressure to perform.
                    In the match against Kings XI Punjab, Kohli came out to bat at number three and played an outstanding innings of 113 runs off just 50 balls. He hit 12 fours and 8 sixes in his innings and completely dominated the Kings XI Punjab bowlers. He formed a 147-run partnership with AB de Villiers, who also played a crucial knock of 82 runs off just 42 balls.

                <p class="center">The 82-run knock played by Virat Kohli against Australia in the World T20 2016 was a crucial one as it helped India chase down a challenging total and secure a place in the semi-finals of the tournament.

                    India were chasing a target of 161 runs in a must-win match against Australia, who had posted a competitive total batting first. Kohli came out to bat at number three and played a match-winning innings of 82 runs off just 51 balls. He hit 9 fours and 2 sixes in his innings and played a crucial role in the Indian team's successful run chase.
                    
                    Kohli started his innings cautiously, taking time to settle in and assess the conditions.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">82* vs PAK T20WC 2016</h2>
                <p class="center">With Inda under massive pressure in the 160-run chase, Kohli defied all odds to play one of the finest innings of his career. He scored an unbeaten 82 off 53 deliveries laces with four sixes and six fours to help the Men in Blue clinch a last-ball thriller in their T20 World Cup opener.
                    With 48 to get off the last three overs, Kohli launched an onslaught against the Pakistan bowlers and took the likes of Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf to the cleaners to get India over the line. Gambhir echoed the sentiments of many in rating Kohli's 82 against Pakistan at MCG above his Mohali knock considering the pressure and the magnitude of the game.
